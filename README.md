## Introduction and Significance
Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is a heterogeneous and chronic autoimmune disease.<sup>1</sup> T1D has two subcategories: **Type 1a** and **Type 1b**. Type 1a accounts for the majority of instances and is caused by the destruction of pancreatic beta (Œ≤)-cells mediated by autoreactive T-cells of the immune system. In contrast, Type 1b accounts for a small minority due to the unknowingly spontaneous failure of Œ≤-cells.<sup>2</sup> As of 2017, the global prevalent cases for T1D was estimated to be **9,004,610**.<sup>3</sup> Over the past few decades, diabetes has also been progressively rising in both incidence and prevalence, making it a public health concern.<sup>3</sup>

T1D is attributed to **insulin deficiency** due to an immune-mediated attack and destruction of the pancreatic Œ≤-cells. The disease progresses in two phases, where:
- **Innate immune system**: Initiation phase  
- **Adaptive immune system**: Execution phase  

Initial Œ≤-cell attack and destruction is triggered by the invasion of activated T-lymphocytes into the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas, leading to targeted Œ≤-cell killing.<sup>4</sup>  

Rigorous scientific research in the field of T1D using animal models has provided evidence of the upregulation of several genes linked to inflammation, immune system disruption, and Œ≤-cell destruction. Examples include:
- **Cytokines**: Interferon gamma (INF-ùõæ), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-Œ±), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1Œ≤)  
- **Other genes**: HLA genes (HLA-DQ, HLA-DR), INS (Ins1, Ins2), CTLA4, PTPN22, and IL2RA.<sup>5</sup>

People diagnosed with T1D face several lifestyle limitations, including continuous monitoring of insulin levels, diet control, adequate physical activity, and stress regulation.<sup>6</sup> T1D also results in many secondary health complications due to high blood glucose, such as cardiovascular and neurological complications, blindness, kidney failure, and lower limb amputation.<sup>6</sup> Furthermore, diabetes can increase the likelihood of various cancers, stroke, renal failure, erectile dysfunction, myocardial infarction, and other prevalent diseases.<sup>7</sup>

Despite extensive research, the most prevalent T1D treatment remains **exogenous administration of insulin** alongside frequent glucose monitoring. However, insulin therapy:
- Does not accurately replicate endogenous insulin secretion kinetics, thus may not fully prevent hyperglycemia-induced damage.
- Does not uniformly work across all patient demographics (e.g., hyper-labile individuals).<sup>8</sup>

Hence, a permanent solution remains elusive. A novel approach that would significantly improve the lifestyle of those with T1D‚Äîand reduce associated healthcare burdens‚Äîis urgently needed.  

**The ultimate goal** of this research is to investigate the potential of using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and induced pancreatic cells (IPCs) that are more resistant to stress-induced apoptosis, thereby improving treatment outcomes for T1D.

## Objectives and Hypothesis
The overall objective is to demonstrate that **MSC-derived IPCs** can be genetically manipulated to **better resist stress-induced apoptosis**, thus boosting IPC survival after engraftment and improving the outcome of Œ≤-cell transplantation. Achieving better Œ≤-cell transplantation results is crucial to effectively treat and potentially cure T1D.

1. **Generate functional and immune-protected IPCs** that can be transplanted into mice.  
2. **Reduce or eliminate the need for encapsulation devices or long-term immunosuppression**‚Äîcommon obstacles in Œ≤-cell transplantation.  
3. **Determine whether stress-protected IPCs** can prevent Œ≤-cell loss caused by allogeneic responses (common after transplantation).  

Because Œ≤-cell stress can trigger an immune response, the **hypothesis** is that **targeting genes known to mediate Œ≤-cell stress** (prior to transplantation) will result in IPCs with enhanced protection and survival against stress-induced apoptosis post-transplantation in mice.

## Background
**Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)** are self-renewing stromal cells with multipotency and tropism, allowing them to differentiate into multiple lineages of **ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm**.<sup>9,10</sup> They can form various cell types (e.g., osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, myocytes, fibroblasts, neurons) and migrate to injured or diseased tissues.<sup>9,10</sup> MSCs are found in multiple tissues, including bone marrow, umbilical cord, peripheral blood, adipose tissue, endometrial polyps, and placenta.<sup>9,11</sup> Adipose tissue, in particular, offers abundant availability, minimal invasiveness, and easier tissue collection.<sup>10</sup>

MSCs have **therapeutic potential** in a host of diseases, including autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, regenerative medicine, and even cancer therapy.<sup>12,13</sup> Adipose tissue-derived MSCs (AT-MSCs) have more potent immunomodulatory effects on both innate and adaptive immune systems compared to bone marrow-derived MSCs.<sup>12,13</sup> They do so by interacting with immune cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages, NK cells, dendritic cells, monocytes, neutrophils) via:
- **Cell-to-cell contact**: ICAM-1, VCAM-1 upregulation  
- **Paracrine activity**: Secretome (cytokines, chemokines, growth factors including TNF-Œ±, PGE2, IFN-Œ≥, TGF-Œ≤1, IDO, nitric oxide)<sup>13</sup>  

**Homogeneous MSC populations** are usually obtained by targeting specific cell surface markers (CD105, CD73, CD90 positive; CD45, CD34, CD14, CD11b, CD19, HLA-DR negative).<sup>11</sup>  

Research using MSCs for T1D in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice has shown positive outcomes, including:
- Damaged neuron and astrocyte repair, reducing cognitive impairment
- Increased regulatory T cells, decreased autoimmune damage
- Reduced islet inflammation, raising insulin levels<sup>12</sup>

**Key challenges in Œ≤-cell transplantation** include immune response induction and rejection.<sup>14</sup> Encapsulation devices have been used to provide a barrier against immune attack while still allowing nutrient diffusion. However, drawbacks include amyloidosis, poor oxygenation, and the need for immunosuppressants (which have adverse side effects).<sup>8,14</sup>

MSCs can be differentiated into **insulin-producing cells (IPCs)** using growth factors, small molecules, and gene editing techniques.<sup>15</sup> For instance, **nicotinamide, exendin-4, and hepatocyte growth factor** support differentiation into Œ≤-like cells.<sup>15</sup> While insulin therapy is over 100 years old, T1D remains **poorly understood** and still lacks a definitive cure. Human trials are limited, and animal models do not fully recapitulate human pathophysiology. However, **humanized mouse models** (e.g., NOG-EXL mice) allow for more accurate translational research.<sup>22</sup> By administering human T cells that recognize human-specific HLA-DQ8‚Äìrestricted insulin epitopes, investigators can mimic T1D in mice.<sup>22,23</sup>

**Stress-induced apoptosis** of Œ≤-cells remains a major barrier to successful IPC transplantation. Stress-related genes include:
- **XPB1**: Upregulated during ER stress and fosters cell survival by degrading unfolded proteins<sup>17</sup>  
- **NLRC5**: A transcriptional regulator where deficiency impairs CTL-mediated killing of NLRC5-deficient cells<sup>18</sup>  
- **CDKN1A**: Encodes a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor that can promote Œ≤-cell apoptosis under stress<sup>19</sup>  

Because MSCs can be cultured in vitro to yield enough IPCs and are **hypoimmunogenic**, they offer hope for improving T1D outcomes through stress-protected IPC transplantation.<sup>20,21</sup>

## Aims and Research Methodology

### Aim 1: Transplanting Isolated MSCs into Humanized Mice and Analyzing the Immune Response
> **IRB Approval (TMU #25.73.5954)**

#### Aim 1.1: Isolation and Identification of hAT-MSCs
1. hAT-MSCs will be derived from **human superficial subcutaneous white adipose tissue** obtained from 5 healthy donors (2F, 3M; ages 20‚Äì30).<sup>24,25</sup>  
2. Lipoaspirate specimens<sup>26</sup> will be digested with collagenase type I (0.075% in PBS at 37¬∞C for 30 min).<sup>27</sup>  
3. The solution will be centrifuged at 1800 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant discarded, and the pellet (stromal vascular fraction + MSCs) resuspended.<sup>28</sup>  
4. Cells will be **maintained at 37¬∞C, 5% CO2, 95% O2** in DMEM with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% FBS until ~80% confluency.<sup>29,30</sup>  
5. **FACS** will be used to identify typical MSC markers (e.g., CD13, CD29, CD44, CD90, CD105, CD73 positive; HLA-DR, CD45, CD34 negative).<sup>31,32</sup>  

#### Aim 1.2: Transplantation of hAT-MSCs into Humanized Mice
1. Cultured hAT-MSCs will be injected intravenously via the tail vein into **female NOD mice** at 12 weeks (n=6). Healthy mice serve as controls (n=5).<sup>35</sup>  
2. **Proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-Œ≥, IL-1Œ≤, TNF-Œ±)** will activate hAT-MSCs before transplantation.  
3. Mice will be euthanized 6‚Äì8 weeks post-transplant, and immunomodulatory protein levels (IDO, NO, PGE2, TGF-Œ≤, HLA-G5) will be measured via ELISA.<sup>36</sup>  

#### Aim 1.3: Expected Results
- FACS should confirm MSC identity: Positive for **CD13, CD29, CD44, CD90, CD105, CD73**; negative for **HLA-DR, CD45, CD34**.<sup>37</sup>  
- **NOD mice** will have high glucose levels and glucosuria.<sup>38</sup>  
- Post-exposure to cytokines, MSCs should secrete **IDO, NO, PGE2, TGF-Œ≤, and HLA-G5**, inhibiting B- and T-cell proliferation, reducing DC maturation, and suppressing plasma cell differentiation.<sup>39</sup>  

#### Aim 1.4: Potential Pitfalls
- Even though MSCs can evade the immune system, there is a risk of rejection.  
- MSCs may undergo apoptosis if unstable in the humanized mouse environment, preventing meaningful immune-response measurements.

### Aim 2: Inducing the Direct Differentiation of hAT-MSCs into Insulin-Producing Cells (IPCs)
> **IRB Approval (TMU #12.23.8976)**

#### Aim 2.1: Isolation, Expansion, and Verification of hAT-MSCs
1. hAT-MSCs derived from **liposuction aspiration** of 5 healthy, HLA-A2-negative donors.<sup>40</sup>  
2. Lipoaspirates will be centrifuged; pellets resuspended in DMEM.<sup>40</sup>  
3. Cells plated at **5 x 10^5 cells/mL**, incubated at 37¬∞C, 5% CO2 for 3 days; non-adherent cells discarded.<sup>40</sup>  
4. Phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) will confirm **spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like** cells, and flow cytometry will analyze surface markers (CD73, CD90, CD105, CD14, CD34, CD45).<sup>36,41</sup>  

#### Aim 2.2: Directed Differentiation of hAT-MSCs into IPCs
1. A **three-step differentiation** protocol (~26 days) will be used:<sup>41</sup>  
   - **Step 1 (2 days)**: Low-glucose DMEM + Œ≤-mercaptoethanol + nicotinamide  
   - **Step 2 (10 days)**: High-glucose DMEM + Œ≤-mercaptoethanol + nicotinamide ‚Üí promotes PEC formation  
   - **Step 3 (14 days)**: High-glucose DMEM + Œ≤-mercaptoethanol + nicotinamide + exendin-4 ‚Üí promotes final IPC maturation  
2. **PCM** and **RT-PCR** will verify IPC formation, checking expression of pancreatic-endocrine genes: **PDX-1, Pax4, Ngn3**.<sup>42</sup>  

#### Aim 2.3: Expected Results
- **AT-MSCs**: Spindle-shaped, fibroblast-like; positive for CD73, CD90, CD105, negative for CD14, CD34, CD45.<sup>36</sup>  
- **IPCs**: Rounded phenotype, increased expression of PDX-1, Pax4, Ngn3, and insulin gene compared to baseline MSC expression levels.<sup>42</sup>  

#### Aim 2.4: Potential Pitfalls
- **Low differentiation efficiency** and **functional immaturity** of IPCs.<sup>43</sup>  
- AT-MSCs could differentiate into adipocytes, osteoblasts, or chondrocytes instead, but Œ≤-mercaptoethanol is expected to mitigate that.<sup>41</sup>  
- Generating large-scale, high-purity MSCs is challenging; **bioreactors** may be needed for industrial-scale expansion.<sup>44</sup>

### Aim 3: Generating IPCs Better Protected From Stress-Induced Apoptosis and Transplanting Them Into Humanized Mice
> **IRB Approval (TMU #23.45.6789)**

#### Aim 3.1: Generation of IPCs Protected From Stress-Induced Apoptosis
1. **Lentiviral transduction** of previously generated IPCs (from Aim 2.2) will target stress-related genes: **XPB1, CDKN1A, NLRC5** using shRNA plasmids (~4 days).<sup>45</sup>  
2. Post-transduction, cells will be treated with stress-inducing factors (TNF-…ë, IFN-Œ≥, IL-1Œ≤) for 2 days.<sup>45</sup>  
3. **Co-culture with allogeneic PBMCs** (~16 hours) to evaluate T-cell activation and proliferation (CD4+, CD8+).<sup>45,46</sup>  
4. **Apoptotic, activation, proliferation assays** will quantify viability and T-cell responses. Bar graphs will compare transduced vs. non-transduced IPCs.<sup>45,46</sup>  

#### Aim 3.2: Transplantation of Stress-Protected IPCs Into Humanized Mice
1. Transduced IPCs (Aim 3.1) will be transplanted under the renal capsule of **female, humanized NOG-EXL mice**.<sup>36</sup>  
2. Mice are divided into diabetic vs. non-diabetic groups, with or without IPC transplantation. **Diabetes** is induced via **STZ** injection.<sup>47</sup>  
3. Blood glucose is measured by glucometer; insulin levels via ELISA over 8 weeks.<sup>36</sup>  
4. Blood and spleen cell suspensions will undergo **flow cytometry** to quantify subsets of immune cells (CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD19+, CD69+).<sup>36</sup>  
5. **TUNEL assay** on tissue sections will quantify apoptosis. Mice receiving **stress-protected IPCs** should exhibit significantly fewer apoptotic cells than those receiving normal IPCs.<sup>48</sup>  

#### Aim 3.4: Expected Results
- **Lower apoptosis** in transduced (stress-protected) IPCs vs. non-transduced IPCs after co-culture with PBMCs.  
- **Reduced T-cell activation** and proliferation in transduced IPCs.  
- **Normalized glucose** levels in transplanted diabetic mice within ~2 weeks, while non-transplanted diabetic mice remain hyperglycemic.<sup>36</sup>  
- **Comparable immune cell populations** between control and transplanted mice, indicating muted allogeneic responses.<sup>36</sup>  
- Fewer apoptotic (transduced) IPCs vs. non-transduced IPCs via TUNEL assay.  

#### Aim 3.5: Potential Pitfalls
- **Low graft survival** may require multiple transplants; using the omental pouch may improve engraftment.<sup>21</sup>  
- **Insertional mutagenesis** due to lentiviral transduction is possible; using **non-integrating vectors** may mitigate this.<sup>49</sup>

## Summary
Existing treatments for Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) still rely on **exogenous insulin**, which fails to fully prevent complications tied to hyperglycemia. This research aims to harness the unique properties of **mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)**‚Äîparticularly their self-renewal, multipotency, and immunomodulatory capabilities‚Äîto generate **insulin-producing cells (IPCs)** that are **less prone to stress-induced apoptosis**.  

Such an approach could alleviate the **chronic need for insulin**, reduce immunosuppression requirements, and greatly enhance the quality of life for T1D patients worldwide. By advancing the generation, transplantation, and long-term survival of **stress-protected IPCs**, this line of research may provide an effective and scalable strategy in the pursuit of a **functional cure** for Type 1 Diabetes.
